# Code Refactoring

-This was a project to refactor code using proper html semantics, while also improving accessibility.
-This project was completed so that I could get a better understanding of how to use html semantics. Cleaning up existing code helped with better understanding the knowledge. 
-This helped to solve better page accessibility, while also fixing the the stylesheet to mirror or coincide with the html code.
-I learned that using proper html semantics helps make the code look more clean and readable. It also helped me to understand and read the code better.
